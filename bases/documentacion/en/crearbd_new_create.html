The list of languages can be obtained from the file&nbsp; <strong>lang.tab</strong> located in the folder <strong>bases</strong>.</p><p>In addition, a file <em>dbn.par</em> is created  in the folder <strong>bases/par </strong>which updates the file <strong>bases.dat</strong> adding to the database already created.</p><p>Once the creation process is finalised, the operators of the new database must be assigned, because otherwise only the System Administrator will be able to interact with the database</p><p>In order to update the database an ISO file must be created to import the data into the new structure.</p><p>If the file comes from WinIsis or IsisDos, you will have to convert the ASCII character set to ANSI. This task can be completed easily using the MX library functions of CISIS.</p><p>To do this,&nbsp; run the MX in a DOS window from the folder where it is located in the database, and convert it using the following command line:</p><p>mx&nbsp;<em>dbn&nbsp; </em>iso=<em>dbn.iso</em> convert=ansi -all now tell=100</p><p>The ISO file obtained must be uploaded to the data folder of the database created through this process. To incorporate the records use the program MX, using the following command line:</p><p>mx iso=<em>dbn.iso</em> create=<em>dbn</em> -all now tell=100.</p><p>After creating the database, run MX again to generate the inverted file, using the following command line:</p><p>mx <em>dbn </em><a href="mailto:fst=@dbn.fst">fst=<em>@dbn.fst</em> uctab=ansi actab=ansi fullinv=<em>dbn</em>&nbsp; -all now tell=100</a></p><p><em><strong>Note: The mx commands are provided as a guide. For further information consult the reference manual in the CISIS library </strong>.</em></p><p>If the number of records you are importing is not very large (e.g. less than 2000 records)&nbsp; use the option <strong>Utilities</strong> on the toolbar of the procedure <strong>Data Entry</strong> to import records and generate the inverted list.</p><p>As the time assigned by the web server to each process varies with each installation, the number of records mentioned here may vary, it is recommended, however, to use MX as far as possible for these purposes</font></font></p>
