<P><STRONG>Selecting a Database</STRONG></P>
<P>When you select a database, the number of existing records is
shown. It also states if the database is locked.</P>
<P>If the database is locked, it cannot be accessed by any user until
the Administrator unlocks it.</P>
<P>To lock a database use the option <STRONG>Utilities-&gt;Lock
Database </STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">in the
start menu of </SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>ABCD.</STRONG></P>
<P>Only the System Administrator or the Database Administrator can
lock or unlock databases.</P>
<P>Another reason for a database being locked is a possible mistake
created when manipulating it, for example, if the process of creating
an inverted list is unfinished, or if there is a mistake in the FST
when you try to update a record. This situation is also announced
when you open the database. In the latter case, because the database was locked 
by an Administrator, it will be necessary to first unlock the
database and then the records through the utilities' menu associated
with the button &ldquo;<B>Utilities</B>&rdquo; of the tool bar
available for the cataloging process. 
</P>
<P>Locked records are generally produced during the data
entry operation. That is: when a user requests a record to modify,
it is locked to avoid unwanted changes by another user. When
the record is updated, it is unlocked and made available for the rest
of the users.</P>
<P>If the updating cycle doesn't finish, that is, if the record is
not modified or if the editing is cancelled (buttons Save or Cancel
of the tool bar), the record will remain locked for some time (4
hours) to the rest of the users.</P>
