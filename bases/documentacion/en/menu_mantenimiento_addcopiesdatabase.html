<p><strong>You can use this functionality to perform one of these two actions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1-Function to Add copies and loanobjects from Catalog</strong>:fill the Inventory Number field<br />
Using this functionality the user can send in a batch all the copies from the records in the catalogue to the copies database with the status to 2(Sent to loanobjects) and to the loanobjects database.<br />
You can select to import the fields from your catalog that match to the ABCD copies database just selecting the desire field from the list. If you wish to remove one of the fields just select it from the list and click on the delete button (X). The copies and loanobjects records will be added to the ones you already have.</p>
<p><strong>2-Function to Add your copies in the copies database to the loaobjects database</strong>:leave the Inventory Number field blank<br />
Using this functionality the user can send in a batch all the copies in the copies database from that catalogue database to the loanobjects database. The copies status will be change to 2(Sent to loanobjects) if the status is 1(In process in technical office). The loanobjects records will be added to the ones you already have.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>For the two possible actions:</strong><br />
You can select to use the system types to add to loanobject your copies or to use a field in your catalogue copies. Be aware that if you select to use information stored in your catalogue copies the system may not recognize them and you will have to add this type of items manually.</p>
<p>If the user writes down a string in the “from” and “to” fields the system will warn him about the necessity of setting the ranges as numerical values. If the user still does not change the values then the script will end with a warning message informing the user that the process could not be executed.</p>
<p>While filling the fields is a good practice to provide the <strong>v</strong> before each field tag. If the user forgets to add this information the system adds it by default. The same principle applies to the subfields in the way of providing the ^ symbol before the subfield index.</p>
<p>The database will be automatically link to the copies database.</p>
