<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This option enables you to define database variables which you can use for the extraction of statistics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It requires three columns of data:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This file is named <strong>stats.cfg</strong> and is placed in the folder <strong>def </strong>of the corresponding database.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The variables defined here can be used for two types of process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For output of tables of occurence or tables of frequency, selecting the variables going to rows and the variables going to columns</li>
    <li>For preparing pre-defined tables from which the results will be extracted by selecting the name from the corresponding box</font></li>
