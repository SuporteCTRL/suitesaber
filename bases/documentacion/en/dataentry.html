<p><strong><font face="arial"><H4>Locking and unlocking records</H4></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">When a user is editing a record, it becomes locked to prevent other users from modifying it simultaneously. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">When the record is updated or editing is cancelled (buttons save or cancel of the tool bar), the record is freed and made available for the rest of the users.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">If the updating cycle is not finished, that is, if the record is not modified or editing is not cancelled (buttons save or cancel of the tool bar), the record remains locked for the rest of the users for some time (4 hours).</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">There are two ways to unlock a record before the mentioned time expires: </font></font></p>

    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">The user who locked the record can free (or unlock) it by either updating, editing or cancelling its editing.</font></font></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">Using the option “Unlock records” available in the menu </font></font><strong><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">Utilities</font></font></strong><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2">&nbsp;in the tool bar. Only the System Administrator or the Administrator of the Database has access to this option.</font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><font face="arial"><H4>Available options for editing records</H4></font></strong></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">Use the titles of the sections, indicated in the upper part, to navigate inside the form. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">Use <img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos1" src="/../central/dataentry/img/defaultButton_list.png" />&nbsp;to query and pick terms from the controlled list, authority list, dictionary of terms or thesaurus associated to the corresponding field. By clicking on the terms in the list, those will be transferred to the corresponding field. If the field is defined as repeatable, and the entry box has more than one line (TEXTAREA), then, one term will be transferred to each line, creating the occurrences of the repeatable field. If the field has only one line (TEXTBOX) and you select more than one term, those entries should be separated by a semicolon (;). Remember that the display format of the terms of the controlled list may be different to the extraction format of the field; that is, the display format can omit the subfields, but the extraction format can include them. This condition is controlled from the FDT of the database.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">Use <img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos2" src="/../central/dataentry/img/s2.gif" />&nbsp;to open the assistant to manage the occurrences and subfields of a repeatable field</font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">Use <img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos3" src="/../central/dataentry/img/question.gif" />&nbsp;to see the help menu for the data entry into the field</font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial"><font size="2">When you finish editing a record, click on <img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos4" src="/../central/dataentry/img/recordvalidation.gif" />&nbsp;to validate it before storing it in the database (this option will appear only if you created a validation format as part of the files that define the structure of the database).</font></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial">Validation of records</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The validation of records can be defined for each field of the database, a format (PFT) is used to determine the consistency of the data before storing each record&nbsp; or click on the link&nbsp;<em>Validate Record &nbsp;</em>when you are doing a repair of the database.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The form contains an input validation for each field defined in the FDT and a text window to place the validation format to be applied individually to each field.&nbsp; Also, a selection box (<input type="checkbox" value="on" />)&nbsp;which allows recording of the records conditional on the outcome of the validation: if the box is ticked while the record is being entered or modified, then the record will not be recorded if any of the fields fail to meet the validation conditions. The validation condition is considered invalid if the format applied to the field returns a  value.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the input procedure, when updating a record,&nbsp;a format is built where the partial validations are consolidated. This format&nbsp; is applied to the record and through it,&nbsp;it is possible to detect which field generated an error and determine if the error produced permits the updating of the record or not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the record fails the validation, the errors are displayed. If&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;fields generated an error in the validation form they are marked as <strong>Fatal error</strong> (tick the box in the validation form), the record is not updated&nbsp;and a link is displayed allowing you to go &nbsp;back to the changes and make any necessary corrections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If&nbsp; none of the fields that are generating an error are marked <strong>Fatal error</strong>&nbsp;a validation report is issued with the record of updates.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<font face="arial"><font size="2">Use <img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos5" src="/../central/dataentry/img/barSave.png" />&nbsp;to save the record. <font face="Arial" size="2">The record is stored in a defined format if it passes the validation test described above</font>;</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos6" src="/../central/dataentry/img/barCancelEdit.png" <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;to cancel the editing of the record, or</p>
<p><img alt="" align="bottom" border="0" name="gráficos7" src="/../central/dataentry/img/barDelete.png" />&nbsp;<font face="arial"><font size="2">to eliminate the record</font></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="arial"><font size="2">Important note:&nbsp;If the record wasn`t changed it is advisable to use the cancel button instead of the updating one, to guarantee the integrity of the database</font></font></strong></p>
