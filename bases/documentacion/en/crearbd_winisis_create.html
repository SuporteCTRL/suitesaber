<h4><font face="Arial">Create a database by copying the existing structures in Winisis</font></h4><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">A database can be created by uploading a backup of the FDT, FST and PFT in a local definition under Winisis.</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">ABCD allows you to upload the FDT from the local machine and convert it to the FDT structure maintained under this system.</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Similarly you can upload the FST and an output format (PFT).</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Note that the selected output format must be written using pre and post literals in order to reproduce an HTML page correctly. Display formats which contain elements of the formatting language defined for viewing in WinIsis and not in a browser, will result in a syntax error when displayed under ABCD.</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Once these three steps are completed the ABCD database will be created and will be added to the list of existing databases.</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">So that the database can be operated by other users who do not have permission the "System Administrator", needs to enter the option <strong>User Management</strong>, to create or select users who can access the database and give them the proper permissions.</font></p>
