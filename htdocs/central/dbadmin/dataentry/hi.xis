Preface 
1.1  About BIREME 
Year after year, BIREME has been following its mission of being a center dedicated 
to scientific and technical health information for the region of Latin America and 
the Caribbean. Founded in Brazil in 1967, under the name of Regional Medicine 
Library (which the acronym BIREME comes from), it has always met the growing 
demand for up-to-date scientific literature from the Brazilian health systems and 
the communities of healthcare researchers, professionals and students. Then, in 
1982, its name changed to Latin-American and Caribbean Center on Health 
Sciences Information so as to better express its dedication to the strengthening 
and expansion of the flow of scientific and technical health information across the 
region, but kept the acronym. 
Networking, based on decentralization, on the development of local capacities, on 
sharing information resources, on developing cooperative products and services, 
on designing common methodologies, has always been the foundation of 
BIREME's technical cooperation work. It has been like this that the center 
established itself as an international model that fosters professional education 
with managerial and technical information with the adoption of information and 
communication paradigms that best meet local needs. 
1 

IAH User's Manual 
Preface 
The main foundations that gave origin and which support the existence of 
BIREME are following: 
  access to scientific and technical health information is essential for the 
development of health; 
  the need to develop the capacity of Latin American and Caribbean 
countries to operate their sources of scientific-technical health 
information in a cooperative and efficient manner; 
  the need to foster the use and to respond to the demands for scientific-
technical health information from governments, health systems, 
educational and research institutions. 
BIREME, as a specialized center of the Pan-American Health Organization 
(PAHO)/ World Health Organization (WHO), coordinates and conducts technical 
cooperation activities on the management of scientific information and knowledge 
with the aim of strengthening and expanding the flow of scientific health 
information in Brazil and in other Latin American and Caribbean countries as a 
key condition for the development of health, including its planning, management, 
promotion, research, education, and care. 
The agreement that supports BIREME is renewed every five years by the members 
of the National Advisory Committee of the institution (PAHO, Brazilian Ministry 
of Health, Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, Secretary of Health of the 
State of São Paulo, and Federal University of São Paulo ­ Unifesp). The latter 
provides the physical infrastructure necessary for the establishment of the 
institution. 
In 2004 the institution took on the responsibility of becoming a knowledge-based 
institution. 
1.2  The Virtual Health Library (VHL) 
With the rise and consolidation of the internet as the prevailing means of access to 
information and communication, BIREME's technical cooperation model evolved, 
2 

IAH User's Manual 
Preface 
as of 1998, to build and develop the Virtual Health Library (VHL) as a common 
space for the convergence of the cooperative work of producers, intermediaries, 
and users of information. The VHL promotes the development of a network of 
sources of scientific and technical information with universal access on the 
internet. For the first time there has been a real possibility of equal access to health 
information. 
To BIREME, the Virtual Health Library is a model for the management of 
information and knowledge, which includes the cooperation and convergence 
between institutions, systems, networks, and initiatives of producers, 
intermediaries, and users in the operation of networks of local, national, regional 
and international information sources favoring open and universal access. 
Today, every country in Latin America and the Caribbean (Region) participates 
either directly or indirectly in the cooperative products and services offered by the 
VHL, which includes over 1,000 institutions in more than 30 countries. 
The VHL is simulated in a virtual space of the internet formed by a collection or 
network of health information sources in the Region. Users of different levels and 
locations can interact and navigate in the space of one or many information 
sources, regardless of where they are. Information sources are generated, updated, 
stored and operated on the internet by producers, integrators, and intermediaries, 
in a decentralized manner, following common methodologies for their integration 
in the VHL. 
The VHL organizes information in a structure that integrates and interconnects 
reference databases, specialist directories, events and institutions, a catalogue of 
the information resources available on the internet, collections of full texts with a 
highlight for the SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) collection of 
scientific journals, selective information dissemination services, information 
sources to support education and decision-making, news, discussion lists, and 
support to virtual communities. The space of the VHL is, therefore, a dynamic and 
decentralized network of information sources based on which it is possible to 
retrieve and extract information and knowledge to support health decision-making 
processes.

IAH User's Manual 
Preface 
The Virtual Health Library can be visualized as a distributed base of scientific and 
technical health knowledge that is saved, organized and stored in electronic format 
in the countries of the Region, universally accessible on the internet and 
compatible with international databases.

2  Introduction 
The Interface for Access to Health Information (IAH)  was designed for 
information retrieval from ISIS databases in an optimum manner over the 
Internet. 
Written in the IsisScript language (the native code of WWWISIS), it was developed 
for BIREME from 1999, having evolved in conjunction with WWWISIS to support 
new functions such as the reading of large records (1 Mb), generation of XML 
content, etc. 
IAH can be installed on any PC-compatible that has a web server installed and 
configured. It has been tested on Internet Information Server (IIS) versions 4 and  
5 and on Apache Web Server (Apache) 1.3.xx. The latter was tested exhaustively 
under Windows and Linux. 
WWWISIS is the active component of the interface which gives the IsisScript code 
multiuser access to the ISIS databases across the Common Gateway Interface 
(CGI). 
IAH comes packaged with the standard version of WWWISIS, with a key size of 
10/30. Meanwhile, if the user needs them, other versions can be used (16/60, Lind 
and FFI).

Introduction 
The availability of the versions mentioned should be checked with Bireme because 
this change can bring undesirable effects and other implications for the 
application.

3  Structure of IAH 
The IAH interface comprises three different parts, in accordance with the 
following model: 
3.1  Documents area 
Primary location of the documents (HTML, javascript, CSS, images, configuration 
files) of the application and the webserver. Normally called DOCUMENT_ROOT. 
3.2  Area of executable scripts 
Location of the executable files, programs or scripts of the application.  In this area 
is located the code of the application, written in the language IsisScript (compiled 
or not)  and the WWWISIS program. Normally called CGI-BIN, this area uses the 
methods and protocols defined for the CGI interface.  Its name can vary according 
to the web server.

4  Requirements for 
installation 
The person who is going to install IAH needs to have knowledge of the operating 
system used, such as the file system, local and remote access control, network 
administration, communication protocols and installation and configuration of the 
webserver. 
The software prerequisite for installation of IAH is a webserver which has a CGI 
interface, e.g. Apache, IIS  or OmniHTTPd. 
4.1  About the installation package 
The IAH distribution package contains all the files and directories necessary for  
the interface, but with a small difference between the version for Windows and the 
version for Linux. 
The package for  Windows is constructed with  WinZip whereas the package for 
Linux uses the uses the tools tar and gzip for combining and compacting files.

Manual del usuario 
Requirements for installation 
Below each of the primary directories (bases, cgi-bin and htdocs) there is a 
subdirectory IAH that contains the files of the application proper. The executable 
of WWWISIS (wxis.exe) for the chosen platform is located in the cgi-bin directory.

4.2  Files and directories of the IAH package 
4.2.1 
BASES/IAH 
Below this directory there are four subdirectories: fsts/, isos/, gizmos/, and 
pfts/. Also there are some special files: 
·  for Windows 
1.  setupdb.bat ­ batch file for the generation of database and inverted file 
with option for data in ASCII or ANSI codes 
2.  inverte-dblil.bat ­ batch file for generating inverted file of the example 
LILACS database in ANSI code 
3.  inverte-dbsecs.bat ­ batch file for generating inverted file of the example  
SECS database in ASCII code 
4.  mx.exe ­ MX utility 
·  for Linux 
1.  setupdb.sh ­ shell file for the generation of database and inverted file with 
option for data in ASCII or ANSI codes 
2.  inverte-dblil.sh ­ shell file for generating inverted file of the example 
LILACS database in ANSI code 
3.  inverte-dbsecs.sh ­ shell file for generating inverted file of the example  
SECS database in ASCII code 
4.  mx ­ MX utility 
In the subdirectories are located the files necessary for carrying out a "standard 
installation", with two databases of reduced numbers of records, one using the 
Secs format and the other, Lilacs. 
In fsts/ are found the field selection tables for the databases. 
In gizmos/ there are various ISIS databases (.mst, xrf and id files) which complement the interface, the conversion table for characters, gizmo and related 
tasks. 
Finally in pfts/ are the various display formats for the example databases.

Manual del usuario 
Requirements for installation 
4.2.2 
HTDOCS/IAH 
This directory contains four subdirectories (E/, I/, P/ and fulltext/), two database definition files (DBLIL.def and DBSECS.def), a configuration file for IAH 
(iah.def) and some application files. 
In the subdirectory fulltext/ there are files for providing access to full texts.  In each of the subdirectories E/, I/, and P/ there are two subdirectories: image/ and help/. In the first are the image files used by the interface such as icons, buttons,  banners, logos etc. In the second are the files containing the help texts of 
the interface in the respective languages in HTML format. 
The file iah.htm contains the initial page of the  IAH interface after its installation 
and configuration and allows access to the databases. 
4.2.3 
CGI-BIN 
In this directory is found the executable file of WWWISIS (wxis.exe) for 
interpreting and executing the application IAH written in IsisScript. 
4.2.4 
CGI-BIN/IAH  
There are six subdirectories (A/, E/, I/, modules/, P/, translate/) and the code of the application (iah.xic). 
In the subdirectories of each language are the format files which form the pages of 
the interface in that language. 
The subdirectory modules/ contains optional modules and language extensions 
that permit the additional use of new functions with more flexibility, as well as 
customisations. 
The subdirectory translate/ contains a translation tool aimed to help user in translating pages to other languages using batch files, the MX utility and some 
gizmo files (master files). 
12 

 
5  How to install IAH 
To install the IAH interface it is necessary to: 
1.  create the root structure in which to expand the package, whether in Linux or 
Windows; 
2.  download the IAH package for the chosen plataform; 3.  expand the package into the appropriate directory; 4.  configure the definition files in accordance with the defined location; 
In figures 1 and 2 the standard location of the databases can be seen in the 
directory structure. The name of the database directories and their physical 
location can be changed by users to adapt to the standard used in their institution. 
However,  it should be noted that there are minimum requirements that must be 
obeyed for the interface to function correctly.  
The principal directory of the interface (or root directory of IAH) is the 
subdirectory iah/, which should be located below the area designated as 
DOCUMENT ROOT of the webserver so that it can be accessed from the static 
pages of the interface, as well as configuration files, the help text, images etc., in 
each of the available languages. 
On the webserver it is necessary to have a directory of  CGI scripts which can run 
WWWISIS (wxis.exe). 
13 

 
6  How to configure IAH  
The first task after the expansion of the IAH package is the configuration of the 
definition file for the interface (iah.def).

Manual del usuario 
How to configure IAH 
6.3  Initial testing of the interface 
Using an Internet browser (Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Netscape etc.) type in the 
the address box the URL in which IAH was installed, e.g. 
http://my-server/iah/I/index.htm 
where  my-server is the name of the domain where the package is installed. 
It is possible to access an installation in local mode using localhost or 
127.0.0.1 as the name of the domain. 
From this page it is possible to select the example databases which accompany the 
package (DBLIL and DBSECS). 
It is suggested that you perform a search in the example databases (LILACS and 
SeCS)  in order to confirm that the interface is functioning correctly before proceeding with the process of installation and configuring your own databases, 
personalizing the layout, etc. 
In case of error you can use the URL below: 
http://my-server/cgi-bin/wxis.exe?hello 
http://my-server/cgi-bin/wxis.exe?IsisScript=getenv.xis 
 
17 

 
7  Your own databases 
IAH is normally distributed with two databases in the formats used in the LILACS 
and SECS programmes. 
To install and configure your own database, you need to follow the following steps: 
7.1  How to install a new database 
1.  Transfer to the directory ISOS (bases/iah/isos) the file(s) in ISO format of 
the desired database(s) 
2.  Transfer to the directory FSTS (bases/iah/fsts) the FST file(s) of the 
database(s) 
3.  Transfer to the directory PFTS (bases/iah/pfts/?/) the display format 
files of the chosen database(s). The &quot;?&quot; corresponds to the language subdirectories of the interface (E/, I/ and P/). 
Note: Commands for indenting and vertical and horizontal space (characteristics 
of the CDS/ISIS format language) must be changed to their equivalents in HTML. 
Fields which contain symbols for control of filing (e.g. &lt;A&gt;, &lt;The&gt;, &lt;La&gt;, etc.)

b)  Execute the command setupdb (shell or batch file ­ depending on the 
operating system), giving the name of the ISO file (including the extension), name of the FST file FST (including the extension) and the name of the resultant database (e.g. setupdb.bat base.iso base.fst base). 
!  If the database has been set up with the ANSI 
(Windows) character table, use the fourth parameter, ANSI, in the instruction setupdb. 
The default for inversion is ASCII. 
Create a copy of the file DBLIL.def with the name of your database, e.g. video.def and edit it for the requirements of your database, in accordance with the section How to configure a new database. 
5.  Add to the page for access to databases a link to this new database conforming 
to the following model: &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF = &quot;/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xic&amp;base= database&amp;lang=p&quot;&gt; Database&lt;/A&gt; - Text describing the database&lt;/p&gt; The terms in bold should be altered to reflect the details of your own database. 
7.2  How to configure a new database 
To configure a database in IAH it is necessary to alter some parameters in the 
database definition file (base.def), whose name is defined by the user during the 
installation (7.1, item 5) and which can be based on the definition of the LILACS 
database (DBLIL.def). 
Therefore, base.DEF is a text file composed of six sections, whose functions are 
detailed in table 3. 
TÍTLE of the SECTION 
DESCRIPTION 
[FILE_LOCATION] 
Location of the database files, display formats and of export of data 
[INDEX_DEFINITION] 
List of definitions of indexes that can be accessed in searching 
[APPLY_GIZMO] 
List of files used for the global change of contents 
[FORMAT_NAME]

Your own databases 
7.2.1 
Section FILE_LOCATION 
In this section you should define the logical names of databases, inverted files, files 
for display formats and conversion of data, all with their respective physical paths. 
For each database, you need to define three files: the database, the inverted file(s), 
and the display format files. For the definition of the database file the logical name  
DATABASE must be used. 
Each definition is preceded by the instruction FILE in the general form: 
FILE LOGICAL_NAME.*=/directory-1/directory-n/file_name.* 
Using the definition of a database of the type LILACS and name &quot;video&quot; as 
example, the declaration results in: 
FILE DATABASE.*=/home/user/bases/iah/vídeo.* 
To ensure that the interface is portable to any directory structure, three variables 
have been predefined: 
6.  %path_database% 7.  %path_cgi-bin% 8.  %lang% 
The variables %path_database% and %path_cgi-bin% get their values from  the settings of  PATH_DATABASE and PATH_CGI-BIN, respectively, of the file 
iah.def, while the variable %lang% receives the identifying letter of the language (p, e, i) according to the selection made by the user through the interface. 
Hence the definition of the database file can be written like this: 
FILE DATABASE.*=%path_database%video.* 
In the same way, the definition of a display format can be written: 
FILE standard.pft=%path_database%pfts/%lang%/lildhtm.pft 
Note that the standard structure of the package is used in all the examples.

7.2.2 
Section INDEX_DEFINITION 
In this section you should define the indexes availables for the search. It is possible 
to mount an indexing FST or an FST with prefixes. The use of a fixed descriptive 
element of index excludes or includes other variables, dependening on  the group 
to which they pertain. The elements referring to the language are neuter and 
optional. 
Each definition is preceded by the term INDEX, followed by a prefix which can 
have various descriptive elements identified in subfields following table 4. 
Element Group  Description ^p 
standard 
Name of the index in the Portuguese language (1) 
^e 
standard 
Name of the index in the Spanish language (1) 
^i 
standard 
Name of the index in the English language (1) 
^d 
standard 
Marks the default index (2) 
^f

Indicates availability of the field only in the advanced form (content: &quot;A&quot;) (3) 
^t 
standard 
Type of the index (&quot;short&quot; for short index, &quot;hidden&quot; for hidden index) (3) 
^g

Identifies the prefix refering to the form or note associated with the search index. It works in conjunction with the definition of specific notes for the fields in the section HELP_FORM 
Table 4: Components of the definition of indexes. 
(1) Optional element in accordance with the selected language. (2) Mandatory element for the default index. (3) Optional element. 
As a general form, we have: 
INDEX XX=^p&lt;Nome&gt;^e&lt;Name&gt;^i&lt;Name&gt;^d*^s&lt;Tag&gt;^fA^t&lt;short|hidden&gt; 
So, the definition of a word index to present as default could be: 
INDEX TW=^pPalavras^ePalabras^iWords^d* 
21 

Manual del usuario 
Your own databases 
In the example above, the index shown as "Words" in English, would be the default  
and would perform a search in all the fields defined in the FST. This definition also 
implies an FST without field prefixes. 
For an author index composed of the fields 10, 16 and 23 and shown only in the 
advanced form, the declaration would be: 
INDEX AU=^pAutor^eAutor^iAuthor^s10,16,23^fA 
For an index of subject descriptors identified by the prefix &quot;MH&quot; in the FST and 
available only in the English language, the declaration would be: 
INDEX MH=^iSubject descriptor^xMH ^uMH_^yDATABASE^mMH_ 
For an index of words from the abstract identified by the prefix &quot;AB&quot; in the FST 
and with reference to an inverted file with the name &quot;RESUMEN&quot; we would have 
in the files section of the definition: 
FILE RESUMEN.*=/home/user/bases/iah/resumen.* 
and in the definition of indexes: 
INDEX AB=^pPalavras do resumo^ePalabras of the resumen^iAbstract words^xAB ^uAB_^yRESUMEN^mAB_ 
7.2.3 
Section APPLY_GIZMO 
In this section you should indicate the files for the global changes of strings of 
characters contained in the databases (GIZMO files), permitting conversion of 
character tables, coding/decoding  of data, compression of information, etc. 
The logical names must be defined in the section FILE_LOCATION 
Each definition should be preceded by the term GIZMO, with the general form: 
GIZMO LOGICAL_NAME 
The standard IAH package contains some predefined GIZMO databases:

You can specify the database GIZMO ASC2ANS for converting data recorded in the 
database in ASCII format into ANSI as follows: 
GIZMO=ASC2ANS 
7.2.4 
Section FORMAT_NAME 
In this section you define the logical names of the available display formats and 
their descriptions in the three languages. 
Each definition is preceded by the term FORMAT, followed by the real name and 
of the descriptions for each language (^p for Portuguese, ^e for Spanish, and ^i 
for English) like this: 
FORMAT xxxxx=^pnononon^enononon^inononon 
The installation package comes accompanied by six display format files for the 
language of the interface: four for the LILACS model and two for the SECS model. 
The four formats for LILACS are: long, detailed, citation and title. The default 
format is citation.  The files (with the extension .pft) defined for each of the 
formats must be declared in the section [FILE_LOCATION]. 
The definition of the detailed format is declared  like this: 
FORMAT detailed.pft=^pDetalhado^eDetallado^iDetailed 
The declaration FORMAT DEFAULT specifies which is the default for the interface 
and should preferably be the last declaration of this section.  Note that the format 
must have been declared previously:  
FORMAT DEFAULT=detailed.pft

7.2.5 
Section HELP_FORM 
In this section you define the HTML files for help and the explanatory notes for 
each type of form (free, basic and advanced) and/or the indexes availables in the 
interface.  It is assumed that these files are located under the root of IAH in the 
subdirectory help below each language (P, E, I). 
The content of these files can be generic, serving all the elements of a particular 
category  (form or index), or specific, for determining one element within the 
category. For example, you can define a help file which serves all the available 
indexes and additionally a help file that gives more detail of one of them.  
To define a generic help text, the declaration should be preceded by the term 
HELP FORM or HELP INDEX and followed by the physical name of the file. 
For example: 
HELP FORM=help_forms.html 
HELP INDEX=help_indexes.html 
To define a specific help text, the declaration should include the type of search 
form (F: free, B: basic and A: advanced) and/or index (in accordance with the 
section INDEX_DEFINITION). 
For example: 
HELP FORM F=help_form_free.html 
HELP INDEX TW=help_index_words.html 
To define a test for  explanatory notes, the declaration should be preceded by the 
term NOTE FORM or NOTE INDEX in place of HELP FORM and HELP 
INDEX. The rest of the procedure is identical.

7.2.6 
Section PREFERENCES 
In this section you define some options of the interface for the particular database.  
The declarations contained in this section are the following:  
·  AVAILABLE FORMS 
Determines the set of forms availables, the first one listed being the default in the initialization.  The forms are identified by letters as shown in  Table 6. 
Identifier Form F 
Free 
B 
Basic 
A 
Advanced 
Table 6: Identifiers of Forms. 
The definition is preceded by the term AVAILABLE FORMS, followed by the list of identifiers of forms separated by commas, as: 
AVAILABLE FORMS=F,A 
This declaration informs IAH that there are two search forms available  (Free and Advanced), with the free form being the default in the initialization. 
·  SEND RESULT BY EMAIL 
Determines whether or not the sending of search results by email is enabled.  The possible values are  ON and OFF.  For this option to function correctly the user should install and configure an SMTP program and create a routine for receiving the parameters sent by the interface. The command which is executed when this option is activated should be given  in the file sendmail.conf of the directory root of the IAH (/home/user/htdocs/iah/). Under Windows the content of the file sendmail.conf could be: 
EXECUTE=blat &lt;file&gt; -subject Results -to &lt;mailto&gt; -q -html 
Under Linux the content would be: 
EXECUTE=/home/user/iah/cgi-bin/email.sh &lt;mailto&gt; &lt;file&gt; 
!  The program responsible for sending e-mail does 
not form part of the IAH package. Under Linux, the shell shown in the example is  responsible for passing the two required parameters to the chosen mail program. 
SEND RESULT BY EMAIL=OFF 
·  NAVIGATION BAR 
Determines whether the navigation bar between the retrieved documents should be shown or not.  The possible values are ON and OFF. 
26 

Manual del usuario 
Your own databases 
NAVIGATION BAR=ON 
·  DOCUMENTS PER PAGE 
Determines the maximum number of documents shown in the results page of a search. 
DOCUMENTS PER PAGE=20 
·  FEATURES 
Indicates additional characteristics of IAH availables for use.  Currently, the package only supports the XML standard in the export of records. 
For example: 
FEATURES=XML 
7.3  Management of multiple databases with a 
different layout 
A single instance of IAH can hold a large quantity of databases and yet permit the 
layout, the colours and the output format of data be changed. 
When you want to add new databases in IAH (e.g. rare books and institutional ­ 
referred to here as &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;videos&quot;) with clearly distinct visual identities, you 
should start with the preparation of the environment in which you replicate the 
parameters of the installation model. 
In the following steps it is assumed that the databases are compatible with the 
LILACS model. 
1.  Create a subdirectory for each database in the root of the IAH documents and 
in the area of display formats, e.g. 
htdocs\iah\rare 
htdocs\iah\videos 
bases\iah\pfts\rare 
bases\iah\pfts\videos 
2.  Copy the files \htdocs\iah\iah.def and \htdocs\iah\dblil.def for each 
subdirectory of the area of documents (htdocs\iah\rare and htdocs\iah\videos) 
27 

Manual del usuario 
Your own databases 
3.  Copy the subdirectories E, I and P below \htdocs\iah for each subdirectory of 
the area of documents (htdocs\iah\rare and htdocs\iah\videos) 
4.  Copy the subdirectories E, I and P abajo of \bases\iah\pfts for each 
subdirectory of the area of databases (bases\iah\pfts\rare and bases\iah\pfts\videos) 
With the structure prepared, you can commence the customization of each new 
virtual instance of IAH, as follows: 
!  In the steps below it is shown how to configure 
the instance &quot;rare&quot; which was prepared previously. 
1.  Edit the file htdocs\iah\rare\iah.def, changing the line below from: 
PATH_DATA=/iah/ 
to: 
PATH_DATA=/iah/rare/ 
2.  Rename the file htdocs\iah\rare\dblil.def to htdocs\iah\rare\rare.def 
!  Although this step is not required, it takes the 
operation clearer. 
3.  Edit the file htdocs\iah\rare\rare.def, changing the lines below, described in 
the section FILE_LOCATION: 
from: 
FILE DATABASE.*=%path_database%dblil.* 
FILE standard.pft=%path_database%pfts/%lang%/lillhtm.pft 
FILE detailed.pft=%path_database%pfts/%lang%/lildhtm.pft 
FILE citation.pft=%path_database%pfts/%lang%/lilchtm.pft 
FILE citation.xml=%path_database%pfts/lilCitationXML.pft

FILE detailed.pft=%path_database%pfts/rare/%lang%/lildhtm.pft 
FILE citation.pft=%path_database%pfts/rare/%lang%/lilchtm.pft 
FILE mes.pft=%path_database%pfts/rare/%lang%/mes.pft 
FILE title.pft=%path_database%pfts/rare/%lang%/lilthtm.pft 
FILE SHORTCUT.IAH=%path_database%pfts/rare/%lang%/shortcut.pft 
FILE descritores.pft=%path_database%pfts/rare/%lang%/descritores.pft 
4.  Copy the database &quot;rare&quot; (rare.mst and rare.xrf) to the directory defined in the 
option FILE DATABASE of the file rare.def (bases\iah) 
5.  Copy the FST dblil.fst to rare.fst (bases\iah\fsts) 6.  Open a DOS session and change to the directory bases\iah\ 7.  Generate the inverted file for the database with rare.fst using the line below as 
a model: a)  for Windows: 
mx rare fst=@fsts\rare.fst fullinv/ansi=rare now -all 
b)  for Linux 
./mx rare fst=@fsts/rare.fst fullinv/ansi=rare now -all 
Now, you need only to construct the URL for the database with the parameters 
changed to access the new virtual instance RARE. 
Let us consider, therefore, the basic URL of IAH for the example database DBLIL 
in the English language that comes with the IAH package: 
http://domain/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xic&amp;lang=I&amp;base=dblil 
We can separate the terms of the URL into blocks like this: 
Term Code protocol http: domain //domain/ program cgi-bin/wxis.exe 
29 

Manual del usuario 
Your own databases 
root of the application 
/iah/ 
parameter 1: application IsisScript=iah/iah.xic parameter 2: language lang=I parameter 3: database base=dblil 
To construct the appropriate URL for the database &quot;RARE&quot;, you should follow 
these steps: 
1.  Add the name of the directory to the end of  the term &quot;root of the application&quot;: 
/iah/rare/ 
2.  Change the name of the database in parameter 3: 
base=rare 
The table with the new parameters will be: 
Term Code protocol http: domain //domain/ program cgi-bin/wxis.exe root of the application 
/iah/rare/ 
parameter 1: application IsisScript=iah/iah.xic parameter 2: language lang=I parameter 3: database base=rare 
Reconstructing the URL, this becomes: 
http://domain/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/rare?IsisScript=iah/iah.xic&amp;lang=I&amp;base=rare 
Now that there is a separate area configured for the new database (RARE), the 
image files (htdocs\iah\rare\?\image) and the support and help texts 
(htdocs\iah\rare\?\help) can be changed without affecting changes to the original 
files or other virtual instances. 
It is also possible to change the definitions of colour and the names of logos 
defined for the interface, in the case the user wants to differentiate each instance, 
through the parameters defined in the sections APPEARANCE and HEADER.

8  How to use the IAH 
interface 
Any search in the databases is performed through a form in which the user enters 
his/her "search expression", made up of words, terms and boolean (or logical) 
operators. 
After the required database has been selected, the IAH interface presents the "free" 
form (adopted as the default of the instalation), with other forms available: basic 
and advanced. 
The examples and figures are based on IAH configured for the databases LILACS 
and MEDLINE. 
8.1  Free form 
This searches words in all the fields that are inverted word by word. 
8.1.1 
Important remarks 
·  When there is more than one word you should separate them by a single space, 
selecting one of the available operators: AND (to relate) or OR (to sum) 
31 

Manual del usuario 
How to use the IAH interface 
·  If you want to trunacte terms or words partially, use the symbol ($)  at the end 
of the root, for example: infect$ retrieves infection, infections, infectious etc. 
·  It is important to consider the synonyms and variations of the search words 
(e.g. cerebral, brain). 
Example 1: Search in the LILACS database on the diminution of risk of infection by 
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in haemodialysis patients. 
Consider only  the most significant words for your search and type them into the 
available space.  In this example you should leave the operator AND selected so 
that IAH searches for articles that contain all the words entered. 
 
Figure 3: Example of completing the field for a free form. 
8.2  Basic and Advanced Forms 
The Basic Form permits searching in the principal search fields of the databases, 
amongst them: words, descriptors, limiting by subject, author, journal and 
language, so offering access to the indexes of those fields which help to assemble 
the search expression. 
The Advanced Form permits searching in all the fields of the datadatabase and 
has the same resources as the basic form.  
To go to the basic or advanced forms, you have to click the name of the form in 
the upper right part of the free form.

!  When you have more than one word or term in 
the same line, you must use one of the boolean operators (AND, OR, AND NOT) between each term. The operator AND is defined previously as default between one line and another, but can be altered by the user according to the requirements of the search.

Display of the results 
Once the search has been executed, the first part of the page shows information 
about the database searched, the search expression, and some of the references 
retrieved in the search in groups of 20 records, in the display format indicated in 
the CONFIG.  (In the example below the display is in the long format).

retrieved in the search, selected or not, for sending the references by electronic mail (e-mail). This option can include:  c)  all the references retrieved in the search d)  a sequential range of references retrieved, e.g. 1 to 50 e)  The references selected previously in the results page of the search 
5.  In the option to send for printing, the system generates a list with the option 
defined by the user.  From this list you should use the print or capture command of your web browser. °  To print ­ use the option Print of your web browser °  To capture in text format ­ use the option File, Save As of your web 
browser 
6. 
 - command that permits changing the format of display/listing of the 
references retrieved in the search; changing the language of the interface; and the option to include or not the navigation bar.

8.3  Logical operators in the search 
The logical operators or boolean operators are used to relate terms or words in a 
search expression.  They combine two or more terms in one or more search fields. 
The boolean operators are: 
1.  AND - Intersection ­ used to relate terms. 
In a search of two or more terms related with AND,  you retrieve documents which have the terms occurring together.  
Example: Hepatitis B AND Hepatic cirrhosis. 
2.  OR - Union - used to add terms. 
In a search of two or more terms related with OR,  you retrieve documents which have any one (or more) of the search terms.  
Example: Hepatitis B OR Hepatic cirrhosis. 
3.  AND NOT ­ Exclusion ­ used to exclude. 
In a search excluding a particular term you retrieve documents which have no relation with this term.  
Example: hepatitis B AND NOT Hepatic cirrhosis. 
In this example you retrieve documents about hepatitis B excluding documents about hepatic cirrhosis. 
The operator that is pre-selected in the search forms is AND.  In the basic and 
advanced search forms, the boolean operators are in the first column, starting 
from line 2 of the form. 
The relation between the term typed in line 1 and the one typed in line 2 is 
controlled by the boolean operator selected in the first column of the form. 
Select the appropriate operator for correctly relating the search terms.  Only in the 
basic and advanced forms is it possible to employ a search expression using more 
than one boolean operator. 
Example 1: search for the descriptor hepatitis B  related with the descriptor 
Hepatic cirrhosis ­ AND. 
37 

Manual del usuario 
How to use the IAH interface 
 
Figure 10: Example of a search with the operator AND. 
In this example the system retrieves records which contain the two descriptors at 
the same time. 
Example 2: search for hepatitis B or hepatitis C related  with hepatic 
cirrhosis  - OR and AND. 
 
Figure 11: Example of a search with the operators OR and AND. 
In this example it is necessary to use two boolean operators: OR and AND. 
In searches using different boolean operators, the order of the terms in the form 
can cause a difference.  To clarify, we follow the logic of the mathematical 
expresions. 
Supposing that the set of documents about hepatitis B is A, the set of documents 
about  hepatitis C is B and the set of documents about hepatic cirrhosis is C; 
the search expression which corresponds to the example is the union of the sets 
A and B, which result is then related with the set C.  As a mathematical expression 
this search can be represented by:

Example 3: search for hepatitis B or hepatitis C and not related with hepatic 
cirrhosis - OR and AND NOT

8.4  Search fields 
8.4.1 
Words 
The words  search field is considered a free-text field, formed of single words.  
Therefore, you should not include in your search articles, prepositions, compound 
terms and phrases. 
The search is processed against the words in titles (original and translated) in the   
abstract and in the descriptors assigned to the document. 
As a search in the free search form:

Example ­ search for "complications of  hepatic cirrhosis" in the MEDLINE 
database 
If the search is in the MEDLINE database, we should preferably use the words in 
English: complications, hepatic, cirrhosis. 
 
Figure 13: Example of a free search with the operator AND (MEDLINE database). 
1.  Type one or more words, separated by a single space and select the operator 
AND (to relate) or OR (to add). 
2.  You should truncate the words to include their variations. For example: 
complicat$ - to retrieve complication, complications, etc. 
3.  For the same search in the LILACS database, you should consider words in 
Portuguese and Spanish. 
 
Figure 14: Example of a free search with operator AND (LILACS database). 
8.4.2 
Descriptor 
The descriptor field is the preferred route for an efficient search  with the best 
results. 
40 

Manual del usuario 
How to use the IAH interface 
This field contains terms which represent the subject of the article or document, 
known as descriptors, keywords, uniterms, subject headings,  MeSH terms 
(Medical Subject Headings), or DeCS terms.   ["Keyword" is somewhat ambiguous 
in English as it is also sometimes used to mean significant  words in the title, 
abstract, etc.] 
The descriptors are in Portuguese, which permits the search to be carried out in 
Portuguese, although searching an international database like MEDLINE. 
When searching the descriptor field it is very important to know what is the 
correct descriptor, authorised for searching.  The best option is to consult the 
index of the field. 
Example: search for the subject &quot;foetal alcoholic syndrome&quot;  
Step 1- in the basic or advanced forms, do not type in the white boxes.  
1.  Select in line 1 of the descriptor search field, having clicked the button which 
matches in the box reserved for the fields 
2.   Click the image 
 to open the page for access to the index of the field 
selected in the form.

2.  To relate this descriptor with another descriptor or with another search field 
(language, author, etc.) click the button 
. 
The system transfers the descriptor selected to the search form. 
8.4.3 
Author 
The search field Author contains the fornames and surnames of the authors of the 
articles or documents recorded in the databases. 
In the MEDLINE database, the authors are indexed in the format of surname 
and initials, without a comma between the surname and the initials and without a 
full stop after the initials. 
42 

Manual del usuario 
How to use the IAH interface 
Example: WILLIAMS AF 
In the LILACS database and other databases, the authors are indexed in the format 
of surname and forenames, separated by a comma, as they appear in the article. 
Example: SILVA, Antonio Carlos Pereira  
The names of the authors do not always apear  in a standarized manner. See the 
example where the name of the autor Adib Domingos Jatene appears in the author 
index of the MEDLINE and LILACS databases. 
MEDLINE LILACS 
 
 
Figure 18: Comparison of the author indexes of the MEDLINE and LILACS 
databases. 
ADVICE: Always where possible enlist the help of the indexes for entering your 
search expression in the form.  If you choose not to use the author index, use the 
symbol $ to truncate part of the forename, e.g. JATENE$.  (This format  retrieves 
all the authors who have the surname Jatene.) 
8.4.4 
Type of Literature 
The search field type of literature only is available in the Advanced search 
form and only in the databases which follow the LILACS system (LILACS,

ADOLEC, BBO, ADSAUDE, etc.) It contains types of literature such as: 
monographs, thesis, project documents, etc. 
Example: to retrieve theses about indocyanine green 
Step 1- in the advanced form type nothing in the first line; select in the 3rd column 
of the first line the field of search descriptor and click  
 ;  to access the 
index, type &quot;indoc&quot; ; select the descriptor and click in 
.

Step 2- go to the  second line, select in the 3rd column of this line the search field  
&quot;type of literature&quot;; click the button  
(the index of the second line); 
from the index select the type thesis and click the button 
 to transfer the 
term to the form.

8.4.5 
Unique Identifier 
The search field unique identifier contains the identification number of the 
article or document in the database. 
A search in this field allows you to retrieve a particular record from the database 
based on the indentification number of the article or document. 
45 

Manual del usuario 
How to use the IAH interface 
The unique identifier is the first item of data that appears in the database record, 
corresponding to the abreviation Id (in LILACS) or PMID (in Medline). See 
the example: 
 
Figure 22: Example of a reference with the unique identifier in bold. 
Very often, the user prints the results of a search and afterwards, to analyse the 
articles retrieved, decides to request photocopies of the articles.  To do this it is  
possible to use the option of automatic completion of a photocopy request, the user 
has only to retrieve again the article(s) from the list of requests retrieved. 
Example: to retrieve the articles whose ID numbers are 176790 and 266022 
and 374112 in the LILACS database.  
46

Type the IDs in the first line, separated with the boolean operator OR and select 
the search field "unique identifier".

Appendix A ­ Indexing 
Techniques  
For IAH to carry out a search in an ISIS database, it is necessary to perform an 
inversion of the data using an FST file (Field Select Table).  FST files consist of one 
or more lines divided into three segments: 
1.  a field identifier (tag) 2.  an indexing technique 3.  a format for extraction of data, in the CDS/ISIS formatting language 
The indexing techniques define the processes which are performed on the data 
generated by the format. 
CDS/ISIS offers nine indexing techniques, identified by a single-digit code, as 
explained below: 
·  Technique 0 (zero) 
Constructs a term from each line extracted by the format.  This technique is generally used for indexing internal fields or subfields.  However, note that CDS/ISIS constructs terms from lines and not fields.  So you should realise that CDS/ISIS considers the output of the format as a string of characters in which the fields are no longer identifiable.  Therefore, it is the responsibility of the user to produce the correct data through the format, especially when indexing repeatable fields and/or more than one field.  In other words, when using this technique, verify that the extraction format for data produces as output a line for each term that should be indexed. 
54 

Manual del usuario 
Appendix A ­ Indexing Techniques 
·  Technique 1 
Constructs a term from each subfield or line extracted by the format considering delimiters.  Since CDS/ISIS looks for subfield delimiters in the output of the format for the technique to function correctly, the format should specifiy proof mode (or no mode, since proof is the default) which retains the subfield delimiters in the output.   Recall that the modes "head" and "data" substitute the subfield delimiters with  punctuation marks.  Observe also that technique 1 is an extension of technique 0. 
·  Technique 2 
Constructs a term form each term or phrase included between &lt; and &gt; (less than and greater than). It does not index any text except between the characteres &lt; and &gt;. Note that this  technique requires the proof mode because the other modes remove the characters &lt; and &gt;. E.g. "Report describing a &lt;university course&gt; on &lt;training in documentation&gt; in an African &lt;library school&gt;" produces the following index terms with this technique: °  university course °  training in documentation °  library school 
·  Technique 3 
Executes the same processing as technique 2, except that the terms are included between slashes (/ ... /). E.g. "Report describing a /university course/ on /training in documentation/ in an African /library school/" produces the following index terms with this technique: °  university course °  training in documentation °  library school 
·  Technique 4 
Constructs a term from each word of the text extracted by the format.  By "a word" is meant a continuous sequence of alphabetic characters. Observe that when you use this technique to index a database with subfield delimiters, you should specify the "head" or &quot;data&quot; mode (mhl or mdl) in the  corresponding format for substituting the subfield delimiter according to the rules of that mode.  Otherwise, the alphabetic codes of the subfield are considered as part of a word.  Also it is advisable to use the "head" or "data" mode if the field that will be indexed  may contain file information, in case the form of presentation of the field is ignored.

Manual del usuario 
Appendix A ­ Indexing Techniques 
!  The definition of "alphabetic characters" can be 
adapted to the needs of each user by means of the System Table ISISAC.TAB. 
·  Techniques 5, 6, 7 and 8 
Indexing techniques 5, 6, 7 and 8 operate in a similar way to techniques  1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, but differ in the application of prefixes to the extracted terms. The specification of a prefix is an unconditional literal using the general form: 
'dprefixd',&lt;CDS/ISIS format&gt; 
in which: 
d is a delimiter character not used as part of the 
prefix 
prefix is the string of characters 
&lt;CDS/ISIS format&gt; is the extraction format for data in CDS/ISIS 
For example: To prefix the words of the field 24 with &quot;TI_&quot;, you should load an FST containing the following declaration: 
24   8   '#TI_#',v24 
in which: 
Format Description '#TI_#' 
unconditional literal 
# 
delimiter of the prefix 
TI_ 
prefix to be used 
v24

Table 8: Example of extraction format from fields in the FST For the sake of comparison, we may observe an FST containing extraction rules with and without the use of prefixes: 
Without prefix 
With prefix 
70 0 mhu,(v70/) 
70 0 mhu,('AU_',v70/) 
24 4 mhu, v24 
24 8 mhu,'/TI_/',v24 
69 2 v69 
69 6 '/KW_/',v69 
Table 9: Comparison of indexing techniques It is important to note that the technique 0 (zero) is unique in that the use of a prefix is an option.  Table 4 shows the relation between the different indexing techniques and the use of prefixes.

Appendix F ­ How to 
construct IAH URLs 
with parameters 
It is possible to construct a URL which accesses directly the search function of 
IAH.  Below is the description of how to construct manually a typical URL. 
1.  Start the URL with the name of your domain in which IAH is installed and the 
search command : 
http://meu-server/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xic&amp;nextAction=lnk&amp; ... 
2.  Add to the URL the paameters for the database to be searched and the 
language of search :  
...&amp;base=BASE&amp;lang=LANGUAGE&amp;...  
where BASE should be the name of the database configured during the installation, for example: LILACS and LANGUAGE should be: p (for Portuguese), e (for Spanish) or i (for English). 
3.  Specify the search expression: 
...&amp;exprSearch=SEARCH&amp;indexSearch=[INDEX]&amp;conectSearch=[OPERATOR]&amp;.... 
where SEARCH should be a boolean expression and  INDEX can contain the specification of the field (for example DE). 
71 

Manual del usuario 
Appendix F ­ How to construct IAH URLs with parameters 
You can create a boolean search expression with a maximum of three different fields,  for which you should use the parameter  concectsearch and state in OPERATOR one of the boolean operators available (AND, OR or AND NOT). E.g.  
4.  To search for the terms &quot;health&quot; and &quot;public&quot; in the LILACS database: 
nextAction=lnk&amp;base=LILACS&amp;lang=p&amp;exprSearch=health+AND+public 
5.  To search the term &quot;hepatic cirrhosis&quot; in the field of the subject headings in the  
MEDLINE database: 
nextAction=lnk&amp;base=MEDLINE&amp;lang=p&amp;exprSearch=cirrhosis+hepatic&amp;indexSearch=MH  
6.  To search for &quot;hepatitis&quot; in the field of words and "English" in the language 
field in the  MEDLINE database: 
nextAction=lnk&amp;base=MEDLINE&amp;lang=p&amp;exprSearch=hepatitis&amp;indexSearch=TW&amp;conectSearch=AND&amp;exprSearch=englsih&amp;indexSearch=LA
