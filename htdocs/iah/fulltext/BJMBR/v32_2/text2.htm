    <p>Gene vaccines represent a new and promising approach to control infectious diseases,
    inducing a protective immune response in the appropriate host. Several routes and methods
    of genetic immunization have been shown to induce antibody production as well as T helper
    (Th) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation. However, few studies have compared the
    nature of the immune responses generated by different gene vaccination delivery systems.
    In the present study we reviewed some aspects of immunity induced by gene immunization and
    compared the immune responses produced by intramuscular (<i>im</i>) DNA injection to gene
    gun-mediated DNA transfer into the skin of BALB/c mice. Using a reporter gene coding for
    ß-galactosidase, we have demonstrated that <i>im</i> injection raised a predominantly Th1
    response with mostly IgG2a anti-ßgal produced, while gene gun immunization induced a
    mixed Th1/Th2 profile with a balanced production of IgG2a and IgG1 subclasses. Distinct
    types of immune responses were generated by different methods of gene delivery. These
    findings have important implications for genetic vaccine design. Firstly, a combination
    between these two systems may create optimal conditions for the induction of a broad-based
    immune response. Alternatively, a particular gene vaccine delivery method might be used
    according to the immune response required for host protection. Here, we describe the
    characteristics of the immune response induced by gene vaccination and the properties of
    DNA involved in this process.</p>

    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
    <p>Gene vaccination is a novel approach to immunize animals and humans against pathogenic
    microorganisms. Introduction of nucleic acid coding for a specific antigen into a living
    cell results in immune activation of the host against the gene-delivered immunogen and in
    some cases protection (1). The use of a DNA plasmid carrying vaccine gene antigens is a
    great advantage compared to the unwanted effects of the introduction of a pathogen or
    recombinant protein lacking conformational epitopes. Therefore, genetic immunization is by
    far the most powerful technique, which resembles a natural infection without side effects.</p>
    <p>The production of genetic vaccines in host cells using DNA has a number of
    immunological features important for the success of vaccination. There are some unique
    properties of DNA vaccines which represent advantages over other immunization procedures:
    i) no risk of infection, ii) inducing a long-lived immune response, iii) eliciting humoral
    and cell-mediated immunity, iv) facilitating the use of polyvalent vaccines, v) good
    stability at low and high temperatures, vi) increasing cytolytic T-cell responses, vii)
    easy preparation and purification, and viii) low cost.</p>
    <p>Historically, Wolff et al. (2) in 1990 demonstrated that nonreplicating DNA plasmids
    encoding reporter genes could express encoded proteins in muscle cells following DNA
    injection. Tang and colleagues (3) in 1992 reported that using biolistic-mediated gene
    transfer by gene gun inoculation, they could immunize animals with plasmid DNA coated on
    gold beads. And in 1993, the Merck research group (1) induced protective immunity in mice
    by immunization with DNA encoding human influenza virus A antigen. Therefore, immune
    responses have currently been induced by injection of naked DNA in saline, or by
    biolistic-mediated gene transfer using a gene gun (4).</p>
    <p>In the battle against infectious diseases, immune responses to antigens encoded by and
    delivered as plasmid DNAs have been raised in a variety of species (humans, mice, cattle,
    dog, ferrets, nonhuman primates) against several different immunogens from pathogens such
    as influenza virus (1), bovine herpesvirus (5), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (6),
    hepatitis B (7), malaria (8), and tuberculosis (9), among others. Besides permitting a
    specific immune response targeted to the encoded antigen, plasmid DNA may be used to
    modulate the immune system in different ways. First, the DNA molecule has its own
    immunostimulatory properties, functioning as a natural adjuvant. Alternatively the
    introduction of plasmid DNA encoding a particular cytokine gene or costimulatory molecules
    may bias the immune response activating the host immune system.</p>
    <p>Successful vaccination depends on the induction of an appropriate immune response
    capable of protecting the host against disease. Here, we are going to discuss the
    qualitative and quantitative differences in the immune response elicited during gene
    vaccination by intramuscular (<i>im</i>) injection or particle bombardment using a gene
    gun. Both systems were able to raise a strong humoral response; however, total IgG levels
    following gene gun immunization were a little higher compared to <i>im</i> injection.
    Regarding the cytokine profile, our data suggest that <i>im</i> injection elicited a
    preferential Th1 type of immune response and gene gun vaccination elicited a mixed Th1/Th2
    profile. Therefore, it is important to stress that, according to the pattern of immune
    response required to achieve protection, a specific gene delivery system might be used.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Gene vaccine delivery systems</b></font></p>
    <p>Currently, there are two main delivery systems used in genetic immunization: plasmid
    DNA injected intramuscularly or DNA coated onto gold beads and transferred into the
    epidermis or dermis by a biolistic process (gene gun).</p>
    <p><b>Intramuscular injection</b></p>
    <p>This is the most widely used method for immunization and it consists of direct
    injection of naked DNA into skeletal muscle. Plasmid DNA in some instances is injected
    into muscle directly in saline solution (1), or after injection of toxins or a local
    anesthetic (e.g. bupivacaine) to cause necrosis and regeneration of the injected muscle,
    increasing the expression of the encoded antigen, and therefore amplifying the
    immunological response (10). In our laboratory, we injected 50 µl of 10 mM cardiotoxin
    (snake venom) into the quadriceps muscles of each mouse five days prior to gene
    inoculation. However, it is unclear whether the enhancement of the immune response is
    directly mediated by the elevated expression of antigen in regenerating muscle cells, or
    via the uptake and expression of the gene of interest by antigen-presenting cells (APC)
    recruited to the site of tissue damage.</p>
    <p>Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses have been induced by direct <i>im</i>
    injection of plasmid DNA encoding immunogens. An antibody response was first reported
    against an influenza virus protein in mice (1), and specific cytotoxic T cell responses
    were also detected in different systems such as HIV and hepatitis B following genetic
    immunization (11,12). Protective immunity was first demonstrated in mice injected
    intramuscularly with nucleoprotein DNA of influenza virus (1). In this model, researchers
    have indicated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contributed to achieve protection.
    Protective immune responses have also been demonstrated in mice against <i>Leishmania
    major</i>, <i>Plasmodium</i> <i>yoelii</i>, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, </i>dengue
    virus, and herpes simplex virus (8,9,13-15).</p>
    <p><b>Biolistic-mediated gene transfer (gene gun)</b></p>
    <p>Biolistic is a method which uses a helium gas pressure-driven device (gene gun) to
    deliver gold particles coated with plasmid DNA directly into the skin. When gene vaccines
    are administered by gene gun technology most of the plasmid DNA is taken up by
    keratinocytes and some dermal fibroblasts, which become transfected and produce the
    encoded antigen.</p>
    <p>Humoral responses using biolistic were first demonstrated by Tang et al. (3) using
    plasmids encoding human growth hormone and human <font FACE="Symbol">a</font>-1
    anti-trypsin. Subsequently, Fynan et al. (16) and Webster et al. (17) used the gene gun
    method in a mouse influenza virus model. Regarding cell-mediated immunity elicited by
    biolistic, the first evidence was reported by Hui et al. (18) who bombarded surgically
    exposed tissues with MHC H-2K<sup>b</sup> molecules and detected allospecific cytotoxic
    responses. Cytolytic responses were also developed in mice bombarded directly into the
    skin with HIV gp120 and <i>env</i> genes (19). Protective immunity has been studied using
    biolistic in different infectious disease systems such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis
    virus (LCMV), <i>Plasmodium berghei</i>, Ebola virus, pseudorabies virus, rotavirus, and <i>Mycoplasma
    pulmonis</i> (20-25).</p>
    <p>To study the immune response induced by <i>im</i> injection and biolistic-mediated gene
    transfer, we have immunized BALB/c mice with a plasmid carrying the reporter gene coding
    for ß-galactosidase (pCMV-ßgal). <a HREF="#Fig1">Figure 1</a> shows that specific
    anti-ß-galactosidase antibody responses were raised using both gene delivery systems;
    however, IgG levels were slightly higher following gene gun vaccination when compared to <i>im</i>
    injection. These data demonstrate the relative effectiveness of these two systems, the
    gene gun and <i>im</i> injection, to mount a specific humoral response. Total IgG
    responses can be detected as early as two weeks after a single immunization with
    pCMV-ßgal using either gene delivery method. However, we have shown that only after the
    third immunization did vaccinated mice reach a peak of total IgG production. The
    qualitative difference in the humoral response observed in <a HREF="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>
    between gene gun and <i>im</i> vaccination is probably due to several reasons. According
    to Barry and Johnston (26), one of them is the fact that <i>im</i> injection places the
    DNA extracellularly where most of it may be rapidly degraded by nucleases. In contrast,
    biolistic delivers the DNA inside the cells, bypassing this initial reduction in
    functional plasmids.</p>

        100 µg of plasmid DNA into the quadriceps muscles. For gene gun immunization, animals
        were bombarded on the shaved abdomen with two shots per animal (below 0.5 µg of DNA per
        shot). Using both methods, mice were vaccinated three times at two-week intervals. The
        control group received pCMV plasmid DNA without the gene coding for ß-gal. On day 45,

    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Antigen expression following genetic immunization</b></font></p>
    <p>In order to develop a proper immune response during a DNA-based immunization, gene
    expression of the encoded antigen must take place, followed by processing and presentation
    of the protein produced by APC. During muscle inoculations most of the antigen expression
    occurs in skeletal muscle, whereas after gene gun immunization, expression is mostly in
    keratinocytes. Robinson (27) proposed different mechanisms by which professional APC could
    acquire DNA-expressed antigens: i) transfected muscle cells or keratinocytes could produce
    antigen that is picked-up by APC; ii) APC could also undergo direct transfection at the
    target site (e.g., Langerhans cells in the dermis), or be transfected by DNA that moved
    from the target site through blood or lymph, to transfect APC in lymphoid tissues. Since
    neither muscle cells nor keratinocytes constitutively express MHC class II or the
    costimulatory molecules required to activate T-helper (Th) cells, their role in antigen
    processing and presentation needs to be better understood.</p>
    <p>One of the most important safety considerations for the use of gene vaccines is the
    possibility of the integration of plasmid DNA into the genome of the host cell.
    Integration would produce insertional mutagenesis with the potential of activating
    oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressor genes. Nichols et al. (28), in a study carried
    out in an attempt to detect integration of a plasmid DNA carrying the nucleoprotein gene
    into the mouse cell genome, failed to detect insertion of the vaccine plasmid. These
    investigators concluded that no integration was detected at a sensitivity of one plasmid
    copy per 150,000 nuclei, which indicates that any mutation frequency induced by gene
    vaccination would be approximately three orders of magnitude lower than the spontaneous
    mutation frequency.</p>
    <p>In <a HREF="#Fig2">Figure 2</a>, we show ß-galactosidase activity in mouse cells after
    gene gun immunization with pCMV-ßgal plasmid DNA. ß-Galactosidase gene expression peaked
    at one week following gene inoculation and decreased to basal levels during the third week
    after vaccination. These data demonstrate that mouse cells were transiently transfected by
    particle bombardment, corroborating the fact that plasmid DNA-based vaccines are designed
    to remain nonintegrated in host cells. Nevertheless, the immune response obtained with
    gene vaccines is sustained for a long period of time, and in some cases a single <i>im</i>
    injection of DNA maintains high antibody levels for at least 17 months (29). The fact that
    muscle cells are postmitotic leaves the possibility of gene expression for months or even
    years. In contrast, gene gun or dermal immunization seems to induce a shorter duration of
    antigen synthesis compared to <i>im</i> vaccination. Overall, longevity of immune
    responses in DNA-based immunization is a phenomenon that still remains to be elucidated.</p>

    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Different patterns of immune response induced by gene vaccination</b></font></p>
    <p>For gene immunization to be considered a viable approach to vaccination, the immune
    response obtained must be shown to be sufficient to protect the host against infection by
    a pathogen. As a matter of fact, protection was successfully achieved against different
    infectious disease models following genetic immunization, as reported earlier
    (13-15,20-25). In a well-studied virus infection system such as influenza, <i>im</i>
    injection of the nucleoprotein gene afforded protection as a result of cell-mediated
    immunity since passive transfer of serum from immune mice did not engender protective
    immunity (1). Depletion experiments demonstrated that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell
    subpopulations were involved in host protection against infection.</p>
    <p>Gene vaccines consisting of a diverse array of pathogen antigens are highly effective
    in inducing a strong MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response as well
    as Th cell activation, and consequently antibody production. Regarding CTL immune
    responses, genetic immunization provides a mechanism to achieve intracellular antigen
    synthesis and to induce MHC class I presentation, mimicking a viral infection. In the case
    of CD4+ T cells, subsets are distinguished according to the cytokines produced (30). In
    mice, the type 1 pattern of immune response activates macrophages to kill intracellular
    parasites, promotes the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, and increases IgG2a and
    IgG3 isotypes via IFN-<font FACE="Symbol">g</font> production (30). The type 2 profile
    helps to produce IgG1 and IgE isotypes via IL-4 secretion and activates eosinophils via
    IL-5 production (31).</p>
    <p><a HREF="#Fig3">Figure 3</a> shows the production of IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses after
    DNA immunization with pCMV-ßgal by <i>im</i> injection or gene gun compared to
    inoculation with recombinant ß-galactosidase in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. These data
    suggest a different cytokine profile induced according to the antigen delivery system used
    in gene vaccination. Intramuscular injection of pCMV-ßgal plasmid DNA induces a Th1
    response compared to gene gun-mediated DNA transfer which elicits a mixed Th1/Th2 pattern
    of cytokines based on the production of antigen-specific IgG2a and IgG1. This result
    agrees with studies by Leclerc et al. (32) and Tighe et al. (33) who reported that
    recombinant ß-galactosidase plus adjuvant induced a Th2 cytokine profile and <i>im</i>
    injection of the gene-encoded protein promoted a Th1 pattern of immune response with IFN-<font

    <p>Different immune responses produced by gene gun and <i>im</i> immunization are probably
    due to the adjuvant effect of the plasmid DNA itself. There is a critical difference
    between these two methods in the amount of DNA required to produce equivalent antigen
    expression. In our laboratory, we have used less than 0.5 µg of DNA per gene gun shot,
    with two shots per mice. For <i>im</i> injection, we delivered 100 µg of DNA into mouse
    quadriceps muscles per immunization. Bacterial DNA and oligonucleotides containing CpG
    motifs have been shown to activate B cells and to induce secretion of IL-6, IFN-<font
    FACE="Symbol">g</font>, IL-12 and IL-18 (34). In contrast, vertebrate DNA did not elicit
    such effects. Therefore, the larger amount of DNA administered during <i>im</i>
    vaccination may be responsible for the polarized Th1 pattern of immune response induced
    (32). This is due to the fact that for gene gun immunization lower doses of DNA are
    sufficient to induce the synthesis of immunogenic amounts of antigen, but are insufficient
    to trigger the production of cytokines responsible for the polarization of the T cell
    response.</p>
    <p><font SIZE="4"><b>Concluding remarks</b></font></p>
    <p>In this study, we have compared the immune responses generated by two different
    delivery systems of genetic vaccination. The characteristic immune response induced by
    gene gun or <i>im</i> immunization has multiple applications in the field of infectious
    diseases, allergy, and cancer. The dominance of the Th1-like response induced by <i>im</i>
    injection of plasmid DNA can be used to modulate an ongoing Th2 immune response, a
    hallmark of asthma and allergic disorders. In contrast, the gene gun technology may be
    applied in the treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases who mostly show an
    inappropriate Th1 immune response. Nevertheless, induction of IgG2a antibodies by gene
    gun-mediated DNA vaccination contradicts the widely held belief that antibody responses
    induced by this method are restricted to those that are Th2 dependent (35). In our
    experiments using the gene gun, we detected a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response, as indicated
    by the induction of antigen-specific IgG2a and IgG1. Leitner et al. (21) observed an
    initial Th2-based response following gene gun immunization that switched to a Th1-like
    profile with activation of IFN-<font FACE="Symbol">g</font>-secreting T cells.
    Additionally, the same group reported that vaccinating mice with the circumsporozoite
    protein-encoded gene either by gene gun or by <i>im</i> injection reduces the rates of <i>Plasmodium
    berghei</i> infection; however, the level of protection obtained was significant only in
    the case of gene gun immunization. In summary, we have yet a lot to learn about gene
    vaccine delivery systems and which type of immune responses they generate.</p>
    <p>The successful use of DNA-based vaccines in different animal models has raised enormous
    interest in this powerful technology. However, little is known about the level of
    protective immunity induced by these vaccines against human diseases. Therefore, we must
    carefully analyze the results of human trials currently in progress to address this
    important issue that will have a tremendous impact on human health.</p>
