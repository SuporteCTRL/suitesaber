          <h1>Basic data entry rules for Serial Titles</h1>
          <br>based on ISBD – consolidated edition 2007 adapted to the SeCS-Web database
          environment.<br /><br />

          1 – When the title contains a set of initials or acronym prominently placed
          on the title page, and the extended form of the title also appears as part
          of the title, enter the initials or acronym in Publication Title (field 100)
          and the extended form in Subtitle (field 110). When the initials or acronym
          are linguistically or typographically separated from the extended form, enter
          the acronym in the Publication Title field, and the extended form in Other forms
          of Title (field 240).<br /><br />Examples:<br />a) Publication title: ABCD<br />
          
          Subtitle: arquivos brasileiros de cirugia digestiva<br />
          b) Publication title: Jornal da AMRIGS.<br />    Subtitle: jornal da
          Associa&#231;&#227;o M&#233;dica do Rio Grande do Sul  <br /><br /><br />


          2 – When the stament of responsibility appears in abbreviated form as initials
          or acronym and as an integrated part of the title proper, it is repeated in extended
          form in the field 140, Issuing body if it appears in the described serial.
          Enter the extended form of the title in Other forms of Title (field 240)<br /><br />

          Examples:<br />Publication title: ALA bulletin<br />Issuing body: American
          Library Association<br />Other forms of Title: American Library Association
          bulletin.<br /><br />3 – When the serial has no other title element than the
          statement of responsibility, enter the statement of responsibility as title
          proper in Publication Title. It is not necessary to repeat the statement of
          responsibility in the Issuing body field.<br /><br />

          Example:<br />
          Publication title: Universidad de Antioquia<br /><br />

          4- When the title consists solely of a generic term such as Bulletin, Journal,
          Newsletter, etc. or their equivalent in other languages, and is linguistically
          or typographically separated from the statement of responsibility, enter the title
          in the form it appears and add the statement of responsibility in Issuing Body
          (field 140), which in this case becomes mandatory to correctly identify the serial.
          <br /><br />

          Example:<br />
          Publication title: Boletim<br />
          Issuing body: Associa&#231;&#227;o M&#233;dica Paulista<br /><br /><br />
          
          
          5 – For homonymous titles, add a differentiating element (qualifier) to all
          forms of title proper (abbreviated title, parallel title, etc.). This information
          should be added in brackets after the title, separated by a single space, as
          follows:<br /><br />5.1 – Homonymous titles with different places of publication:
          add place of publication (city)<br /><br />

          Examples:<br />Publication title: Pediatria (S&#227;o Paulo)<br />
          Publication title: Pediatria (Bogot&#225;)<br /><br />

          5.2 - Homonymous titles with the same place of publication: add place of
          publication (city) and year first published.<br /><br />

          Examples:<br />Publication title: Pediatria (S&#227;o Paulo. 1983)<br />
          Publication title: Pediatria (S&#227;o Paulo. 1984)<br /><br />

          5.3 – Serials returning to a previous title: add place of publication (city)
          and year first published.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Publication title: Revista
          m&#233;dica (1968)<br />
          Publication title: Revista m&#233;dica (1987)<br /><br />

          5.4 – Editions in different languages with homonymous titles: enter the edition
          according to ISO 4-1984 and &#180;List of serial title word abbreviations&#180;.<br />
          Examples:<br />
          Publication title: Abboterapia (Spanish ed.)<br />
          Publication title: Abboterapia (Portuguese ed.)<br />
          Abbreviated title: Abboterapia (Span. ed.)<br />
          Abbreviated title: Abboterapia (Port. ed.)<br /><br />
          
          6 – When a section, part or supplement is published separately and has a
          specific title which can be separated from the main title, and the specific
          title appears more prominently than the main title, make a separate record
          for the section as title proper. Add information in field 560 Is
          supplement/insertion of in the record of the section, and in field 550
          Has supplement/insertion in the record of the main title.<br /><br />
          
          Example:<br />Main title: Veterinary record<br />Specific title: In practice<br />
          a) Publication title: In practice<br />
          Is supplement/insertion of: Veterinary record<br />
          b) Publication title: Veterinary record<br />
          Has supplement/insertion: In practice<br /><br />
          7 – When a supplement has the same title as the main edition and a new record
          is made for it, differentiate it by adding Supplement in field 130 – Title of
          section/part.<br />Example:<br />a) Publication title: Ci&#234;ncia e cultura<br />
          Title of section/part: Suplemento<br />b) Publication title: Acta cir&#250;rgica
          brasileira<br />Title of section/part: Suplemento<br /><br />8 – When parallel
          titles appear on the title page or substitute,  enter as title proper the one
          that appears typographically prominent. When there is no typographical distinction
          between parallel titles, enter as title proper the one that appears first, and the
          rest as parallel titles in field 230. <br />Example:<br />Publication title: Progress
          in surgery<br />
          Parallel title: Progress en chirurgie";
